# WorkerThreadPool

Inherits: Object

A singleton that allocates some Threads on startup, used to offload tasks to
these threads.

## Description

The WorkerThreadPool singleton allocates a set of Threads (called worker
threads) on project startup and provides methods for offloading tasks to them.
This can be used for simple multithreading without having to create Threads.

Tasks hold the Callable to be run by the threads. WorkerThreadPool can be used
to create regular tasks, which will be taken by one worker thread, or group
tasks, which can be distributed between multiple worker threads. Group tasks
execute the Callable multiple times, which makes them useful for iterating
over a lot of elements, such as the enemies in an arena.

Here's a sample on how to offload an expensive function to worker threads:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var enemies = [] # An array to be filled with enemies.
    
    func process_enemy_ai(enemy_index):
        var processed_enemy = enemies[enemy_index]
        # Expensive logic...
    
    func _process(delta):
        var task_id = WorkerThreadPool.add_group_task(process_enemy_ai, enemies.size())
        # Other code...
        WorkerThreadPool.wait_for_group_task_completion(task_id)
        # Other code that depends on the enemy AI already being processed.
    
    
    
    private List<Node> _enemies = new List<Node>(); // A list to be filled with enemies.
    
    private void ProcessEnemyAI(int enemyIndex)
    {
        Node processedEnemy = _enemies[enemyIndex];
        // Expensive logic here.
    }
    
    public override void _Process(double delta)
    {
        long taskId = WorkerThreadPool.AddGroupTask(Callable.From<int>(ProcessEnemyAI), _enemies.Count);
        // Other code...
        WorkerThreadPool.WaitForGroupTaskCompletion(taskId);
        // Other code that depends on the enemy AI already being processed.
    }
    

The above code relies on the number of elements in the `enemies` array
remaining constant during the multithreaded part.

Note: Using this singleton could affect performance negatively if the task
being distributed between threads is not computationally expensive.

## Method Descriptions

int add_group_task(action: Callable, elements: int, tasks_needed: int = -1,
high_priority: bool = false, description: String = "")

Adds `action` as a group task to be executed by the worker threads. The
Callable will be called a number of times based on `elements`, with the first
thread calling it with the value `0` as a parameter, and each consecutive
execution incrementing this value by 1 until it reaches `element - 1`.

The number of threads the task is distributed to is defined by `tasks_needed`,
where the default value `-1` means it is distributed to all worker threads.
`high_priority` determines if the task has a high priority or a low priority
(default). You can optionally provide a `description` to help with debugging.

Returns a group task ID that can be used by other methods.

Warning: Every task must be waited for completion using
wait_for_task_completion() or wait_for_group_task_completion() at some point
so that any allocated resources inside the task can be cleaned up.

int add_task(action: Callable, high_priority: bool = false, description:
String = "")

Adds `action` as a task to be executed by a worker thread. `high_priority`
determines if the task has a high priority or a low priority (default). You
can optionally provide a `description` to help with debugging.

Returns a task ID that can be used by other methods.

Warning: Every task must be waited for completion using
wait_for_task_completion() or wait_for_group_task_completion() at some point
so that any allocated resources inside the task can be cleaned up.

int get_group_processed_element_count(group_id: int) const

Returns how many times the Callable of the group task with the given ID has
already been executed by the worker threads.

Note: If a thread has started executing the Callable but is yet to finish, it
won't be counted.

bool is_group_task_completed(group_id: int) const

Returns `true` if the group task with the given ID is completed.

Note: You should only call this method between adding the group task and
awaiting its completion.

bool is_task_completed(task_id: int) const

Returns `true` if the task with the given ID is completed.

Note: You should only call this method between adding the task and awaiting
its completion.

void wait_for_group_task_completion(group_id: int)

Pauses the thread that calls this method until the group task with the given
ID is completed.

Error wait_for_task_completion(task_id: int)

Pauses the thread that calls this method until the task with the given ID is
completed.

Returns @GlobalScope.OK if the task could be successfully awaited.

Returns @GlobalScope.ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER if a task with the passed ID does
not exist (maybe because it was already awaited and disposed of).

Returns @GlobalScope.ERR_BUSY if the call is made from another running task
and, due to task scheduling, there's potential for deadlocking (e.g., the task
to await may be at a lower level in the call stack and therefore can't
progress). This is an advanced situation that should only matter when some
tasks depend on others (in the current implementation, the tricky case is a
task trying to wait on an older one).
