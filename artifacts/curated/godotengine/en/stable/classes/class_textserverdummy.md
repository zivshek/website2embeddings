# TextServerDummy

Inherits: TextServerExtension < TextServer < RefCounted < Object

A dummy text server that can't render text or manage fonts.

## Description

A dummy TextServer interface that doesn't do anything. Useful for freeing up
memory when rendering text is not needed, as text servers are resource-
intensive. It can also be used for performance comparisons in complex GUIs to
check the impact of text rendering.

A dummy text server is always available at the start of a project. Here's how
to access it:

    
    
    var dummy_text_server = TextServerManager.find_interface("Dummy")
    if dummy_text_server != null:
        TextServerManager.set_primary_interface(dummy_text_server)
        # If the other text servers are unneeded, they can be removed:
        for i in TextServerManager.get_interface_count():
            var text_server = TextServerManager.get_interface(i)
            if text_server != dummy_text_server:
                TextServerManager.remove_interface(text_server)
    

The command line argument `--text-driver Dummy` (case-sensitive) can be used
to force the "Dummy" TextServer on any project.
